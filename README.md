# virus

This project simulates a virus infecting cells and records the time it takes to infect all cells using different strategies. Once all cells are infected
the program repeats itself. The times are recorded in separate csv files and the main program graphs the results.

Also included is a program that utilizes similar point and vector classes to model group behavior. Called boids, this program simulates a group forming and moving
while adhering to certain rules and behaviors.
